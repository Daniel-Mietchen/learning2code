## Offline
Some years ago, whenever I had a quiet moment at home and offline, I was reading a few pages in the book 
> "Python: Visual Quickstart Guide" by Chris Fehily (2001), ISBN 0-201-74884-3

to get familiar with the main design features of Python and the underlying philosophy.

Back then, I was also enjoying the quizzes in the [Python Challenge app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.apps.garden.pythonchallenge).

## SimpleHTTPServer

* ```python -m http.server [<portNo>]``` (Python 3) vs.  ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer [<portNo>]``` (Python 2)
  - [background](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7943751/what-is-the-python-3-equivalent-of-python-m-simplehttpserver)
    - [usage example](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/182369/102837)

## Python events
* [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2016/)

## Binder

  - can do things like [https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/PersonalDataIO%2Fwikidata/master?filepath=WikiData_client.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/PersonalDataIO%2Fwikidata/master?filepath=WikiData_client.ipynb) or [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/sparql-notebooks/master?filepath=wikidata.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/betatim/sparql-notebooks/master?filepath=wikidata.ipynb)
  - has [repo2docker](https://blog.jupyter.org/introducing-repo2docker-61a593c0752d) that allows to use "containerization technology without needing to learn Docker itself" (see [here](https://twitter.com/koehrsen_will/status/1074331468200075264))
