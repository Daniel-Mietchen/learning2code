# About

This file collects information regarding [Octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave), of which I am an occasional user, mostly when it comes to using Jupyter notebooks for exploring [MATLAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB) code, since I do not have a MATLAB license and most MATLAB code runs under Octave, for which there is a Jupyter kernel.

# Running MATLAB/SPM on Jupyter's Octave kernel

* [Example](https://github.com/spm/spm-notebooks)
  - this also mentions a MATLAB kernel, which I have not tested yet
