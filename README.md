# About
This repo helps document my progress in learning how to code in programming languages new to me, with an initial focus on [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). Apart from the outline in this file, the repo also contains a [collection of useful resources](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/resources.md), some [notes on version control](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/version-control.md), some [ideas for programming tasks](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/tasks.md) as well as [notes for a draft report](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/report.md)

## Learning Python
Documentation of my progress in learning Python. 

### Why Python?
More and more of the software I come across in research contexts but also around Wikimedia is written in Python, which means I have seen a fair bit of Python code already, so it's about time to try and actually learn to write it myself in a way that is not too inconsiderate of any readers or users that may ever get.

### Comparison of programming languages
Never having taken any computer science classes, the precise pros and cons of different languages remain somewhat of a mystery to me, but I am conscious that [Python tends to be much slower than compiled languages like C or Fortran](http://jonathankinlay.com/index.php/2015/02/comparison-programming-languages), and that's fine for most of my purposes. I am interested in [ways to reduce the speed gap](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/optimizing-python-with-numpy-and-numba/), though.

## Learning Scratch
Documentation of my progress in learning Scratch. 

### Why Scratch?
I've come across numerous examples of introductions to programming that use visual programming languages like Scratch, Alice or Blockly. Since I am frequently in a position to explain programming concepts to non-programmers, I thought I'd familiarize myself with one of those visual languages, so as to help those beginning coders make best use of the available introductory materials.
