# Learning Python
Documentation of my progress in learning Python. 

## Why Python?
More and more of the software I come across in research contexts but also around Wikimedia is written in Python, which means I have seen a fair bit of Python code already, so it's about time to try and actually learn to write it myself in a way that is not too inconsiderate of any readers or users that may ever get.

## Comparison of programming languages
Never having taken any computer science classes, the precise pros and cons of different languages remain somewhat of a mystery to me, but I am conscious that [Python tends to be much slower than compiled languages like C or Fortran](http://jonathankinlay.com/index.php/2015/02/comparison-programming-languages), and that's fine for most of my purposes. I am interested in [ways to reduce the speed gap](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/optimizing-python-with-numpy-and-numba/), though.
