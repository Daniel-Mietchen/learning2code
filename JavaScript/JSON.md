I was wondering about commenting in JSON, and it turns out to be handled differently from most programming languages that I am aware of: essentially, anything inside a JSON blob is part of its data structure, though conventions within communities or workflows can of course agree on ignoring certain elements of the data structure.

Some more details in [this post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/json-comment-example-how-to-comment-in-json-files/).
