This file is my attempt to report on how I am learning the programming language Python. It complements [resources.md](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/learning2code/blob/master/resources.md) by focusing on the process and circumstances of my learning as a way to help others in theirs. I will include some remarks on how my learning of Python triggered other learning experiences.

## Outline
* Prehistory: school till postdoc
* Version control: wikis, svn, git
* MATLAB
* Pywikibot
* Software Carpentry
* [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/)
  * seen [here](http://ways.org/en/node/1078)
* Python
* StackOverflow
* IPython
* Mybinder
  * [blog post by Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog//2016-mybinder.html)

   * [Jupyter notebook](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.ipynb) (in Python 2)
   * [mbinder version](http://mybinder.org/repo/cranmer/ligo-binder)
     * [seaborn error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33451260/cannot-import-seaborn)
       * solved by adding a requirements.txt file with "seaborn" as content, as per [this example](https://github.com/binder-project/example-requirements/blob/master/requirements.txt)
       * potentially solvable by editing the Docker file
     * discovered [IPython Parallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel)
