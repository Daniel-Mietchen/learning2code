# About

This file assists in defining my rules for my 100 day challenge in 2020. It is a draft.

# Rules
''For the moment, order has no meaning. I expect this to change at some point.''
* The challenge lasts 100days.
* Time zone is "Anywhere on Earth".
* If I am to miss one day, it has to be caught up within 6 days.
* At the end of each day, I propose three possible activities for the next day.
* At the beginning of each day, I select one of the activities proposed the day before.
* I pledge to spend a minimum of 30 min per day and a maximum of 3 h per day on the challenge, aiming for a median of 1 h.
* If an activity cannot be finished within that timeframe, it will be addeed to the pool of proposed activities for the next day.
