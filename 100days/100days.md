# About 100 day challenges

The concept of doing something for 100 days in a row has been around for a while. People do it for various reasons, e.g. to really dive into learning something or to explore whether they'd like to do this in the long run. In contrast to simply accumulating 100 days of engagement with something, the difference here is that you announce your plans beforehand to add an additional nudge to actually do it. The announcement typically comes with a statement of the rules to follow, and possibly with an outline of what is to be accomplished over that period.

# My personal take

I have so far mostly been an occasional bystander on such activities, but [100wikidays](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/100wikidays) caught my attention, and I got Research Bot to [complete it](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Research_Bot/100wikidays). 

For 2020, I am [committed](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/new-year-resolutions/2020.md) to do a 100 day challenge for coding. I am also considering to do one for some physical activity. Not sure yet about a suitable parametrization for either.

Latest possible start date compatible with the pledge: September 23. So let's aim at starting on September 21.

An approach that might suit me is to attempt to do the following on a daily basis:
  - review one piece of code written by someone else and document my understanding of it
  - index at least one reserved word or character combination (from SPARQL or Python) like "SELECT", "return" or "+=" in Wikidata and annotate them accordingly
  - write a piece of code that makes use of that newly indexed functionality
  - optionally, I might try to combine these activities with testing out some tools or platforms that I have listed in my ideas repo as ["look into X"](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%22look+into%22), e.g. for X = ["Visual Studio Code"](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/issues/1293)
  - document progress
  - define tasks for next day
  - communicate updates

## 100 days of code

I am leaning towards starting by going through selected resources and contributing to their improvement in the process:
* The book [Surfing the Data Pipeline with Python](https://jkropko.github.io/surfing-the-data-pipeline/intro.html), written by one of my colleagues [source](https://github.com/jkropko/surfing-the-data-pipeline).
* lessons from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
* Wikidata-related code [hosted publicly on PAWS](https://paws-public.wmflabs.org/paws-public/?C=M&O=D)
  - e.g. [here](https://paws-public.wmflabs.org/paws-public/48245524/) for [MsynBot](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:MsynBot)
    - e.g. [wordcloud demo](https://paws-public.wmflabs.org/paws-public/59320301/word-cloud.ipynb)
* [Template for the 100 days journal](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code)
* [Rosetta Code's Python category](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Python)
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
  - I particularly like the detailed documentation [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/three-ways-to-find-the-longest-word-in-a-string-in-javascript-a2fb04c9757c/)
* [Codecombat](https://codecombat.com)  
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
  - since [2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015)
  - solutions posted afterwards
* [Pytudes &mdash; Python études](https://archive.org/details/github.com-norvig-pytudes_-_2020-02-23_20-54-08)

In terms of documentation, I plan to take inspiration from [Andy Harris: How to Begin Thinking Like A Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azcrPFhaY9k), focusing on getting the algorithm part sorted out first, then reusing the algorithm sketch as comments.
