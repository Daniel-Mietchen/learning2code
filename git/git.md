# About

This file collects information about git. Here on GitHub, git is obviously underpinning much of most activities, but I am regularly finding myself in a position to have to explain it, so here are some pointers. The initial list below was triggered by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/EmilyRiederer/status/1282663842905022464) and the comments it received.
