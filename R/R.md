# About

There are a number of things to keep apart here:
- the programming language R
- RStudio, the (most?) popular IDE for R
- R script
- R notebook
- R Markdown
- shiny web app

I have so far only begun to explore these (e.g. via [this Software Carpentry course](https://hbec-mpi-eva.github.io/2020-11-23-leipzig-online/)), but I see potential in using the R Markdown approach of interlinking code and text.

* ```::```
  - the entity on the right is part of the entity on the left, and the latter is (always?) a package or file
