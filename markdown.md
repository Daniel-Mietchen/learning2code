## Test 1

| We invite you, whether you're in London or afar, to a weekend of learning, making, and doing to advance Open Research Data. The event is hosted by [SPARC](https://sparcopen.org/) and the [NIH](https://nih.gov/) as part of an international celebration for Open Data Day.

At its heart, Open Research Data is about making it easy for you and others to see, use and share data (to find out more, read [this](https://sparcopen.org/open-data/)). This simple idea is powering some of the largest [breakthroughs](https://sparcopen.org/impact-story/human-genome-project/) of our time, and our event aims to celebrate and accelerate the power of Open Research Data.

We invite you, whether new or old to Open Research Data, scholar or citizen, in London or across the globe, to join us for this weekend to make, hack, contribute, try, teach, design, test, learn (or just about anything!) in the name of Open Research Data.

In London, we'll provide fast wifi, power (both for your laptops and your bodies) and a program that will spark ideas and collaborations for the weekend.

If you can't make it to London, join us online from wherever you are.  | [Individual data points](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Dews...%28byNithyaRamanujam%29.jpg)  |
