# About 100 day challenges

The concept of doing something for 100 days in a row has been around for a while. People do it for various reasons, e.g. to really dive into learning something or to explore whether they'd like to do this in the long run. In contrast to simply accumulating 100 days of engagement with something, the difference here is that you announce your plans beforehand to add an additional nudge to actually do it. The announcement typically comes with a statement of the rules to follow, and possibly with an outline of what is to be accomplished over that period.

# My personal take

I have so far mostly been an occasional bystander on such activities, but [100wikidays](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/100wikidays) caught my attention, and I got Research Bot to [complete it](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/User:Research_Bot/100wikidays). 

For 2020, I am [committed](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/ideas/blob/master/new-year-resolutions/2020.md) to do a 100 day challenge for coding. I am also considering to do one for some physical activity. Not sure yet about a suitable parametrization for either.
